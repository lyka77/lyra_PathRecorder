React Native Path Recorder App App
Lyra Kalajian

High-level documentation for each component file used in your app that explains:
the properties passed to the component, explaining the type of each property and its purpose (why is it necessary?)
the state hooks (if any) defined within that component, explain the type of each state variable (using examples) and why that state variable is necessary. 
Describe any features that don’t work quite right in your submitted implementation. (If there aren’t any such features, this section can be omitted). 
Although no above & beyond aspects of this project were required, if you implemented any parts of the project labeled [Above & Beyond], please briefly describe that work here.
Summarize any lessons learned about React Native, JavaScript, and/or git/GitHub by group members while working this app.
